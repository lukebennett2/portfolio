Let’s get one thing straight: I am not a full-stack developer. I’m a creative strategist with a tendency to dive headfirst into things I *think* I can figure out. And this portfolio? Let’s just say it put that optimism to the test.

## From “Looks Cool” to “Oh No, What Have I Done”
It started with a vibe. A few Figma mockups. A cheeky hero section. The idea was to build a portfolio that actually felt like me—fun, sharp, a little odd, but polished enough to show I know what I’m doing (even if I’m winging half of it).Then I decided to actually *build* it.
And in came the tech stack:
- React  
- Tailwind CSS  
- Vite  
- Markdown blog posts  
- And eventually, a full-blown identity crisis when `@apply` wouldn’t work

## The Build (aka Google Is My Co-Founder)

Most of the process looked like this:

> Build something.  
> Break something.  
> Google it.  
> Question my life choices.  
> Repeat.

Tailwind kept gaslighting me about my custom classes. Vite, while fast, occasionally screamed cryptic errors at me in red. I probably reinstalled my node modules more times than I brushed my teeth that week.

There was one stretch where I spent *three hours* trying to figure out why my text color wasn’t showing on a button. Spoiler: it was because I forgot to define `text-background` in a `@layer`. Send help.

## Small Wins, Big Feels

Somewhere in the chaos, things started to click. Components got reusable. The blog posts started rendering. The hero section actually smiled back. It even had a fade-in animation I didn’t totally understand but was *very* proud of.

And when I pushed it live on Vercel and saw it working on my phone? Felt like I just launched a satellite into orbit.

## What I Learned

- I actually love building things from scratch (even when it hurts).
- I can Google better than I give myself credit for.
- Design systems matter—even when it’s just you at 1am crying over a rounded corner.
- Markdown is surprisingly powerful (and kinda fun).

## Would I Do It Again?

100%. This site taught me a lot—not just about the tech stack, but about seeing a creative vision through. End to end. From chaotic concept to something that actually lives on the internet.

I’m already dreaming up version two:  
More motion. More weirdness. Maybe even fewer bugs (lol).

Thanks for reading. Hope you like the site.

P.S. If you find a bug… no you didn’t.
