title: "What a Hackney Wedding Taught Me About Product Management"
excerpt: "Turns out running a wedding reception is weirdly similar to launching a product—minus the whiteboard and with more champagne."

## Not the planner — but still pretty involved

I didn’t plan the wedding.  
But I did end up helping with the reception — from setup to flow to making sure things stayed on track once the party kicked off.

The venue was a blank canvas in Hackney.  
The couple had a clear vision, and a lot of it came together through friends stepping in where needed. I found myself coordinating deliveries, fixing last-minute issues, and quietly making sure the night felt effortless — for them and everyone else.

No official title.  
Just someone helping keep things moving.

## 🛠 Turning a space into an experience

The reception space was beautiful, but totally unfurnished. We had an afternoon to transform it — and very little buffer for things going wrong.

Some of what needed doing:
- Managing delivery windows for drinks, food, and florals
- Troubleshooting the tech setup (Bluetooth issues, of course)
- Responding to guest questions in real time
- Setting up a seating plan, adjusting lighting, cueing music
- Creating a smooth flow from ceremony to reception to dancing — without needing to announce every transition

The goal was for it all to feel natural.  
Which meant behind the scenes, it needed structure.

## 🎂 The small moment that felt big

The most stressful part of the night? The cake.  
It wasn’t about the dessert — it was about getting the timing right.

Lights dimmed at the right moment.  
Plates ready.  
The couple in the right spot.  
The photographer in place.

It took more coordination than expected, but it mattered. Not because of the cake itself, but because it was a moment that meant something to the couple. That made it worth getting right.

## 💃 The after-party: a quiet second act

Once the reception wound down, we had a short window to reset the room.  
Tables moved, lights adjusted, music changed. Drinks restocked. New energy.

Guests barely noticed the shift — and that was the point.  
It was a smooth handoff to the next phase of the evening.

By then, most of the work was invisible. The atmosphere was doing the work.

## 🧠 So what does any of this have to do with product?

A lot, actually.

Weddings (especially receptions) are full of quiet logistics, quick decisions, and experience design. A few things that felt familiar:

### What carried over directly:

- **Stakeholder alignment** → Keeping the couple focused on enjoying the moment, not fielding decisions
- **Cross-functional work** → Caterers, DJs, friends — each with a role to play
- **Real-time problem solving** → Fixing issues quickly without breaking the flow
- **Prioritisation under pressure** → Letting small things go to protect the bigger picture
- **User experience thinking** → Guests move through the space — how intuitive is it? Does it feel good?

## ✳️ A few things that stuck with me

I've worked mostly in digital spaces. But this was a strong reminder that physical experiences are designed too — and often with the same constraints and intentions.

- Where drinks are placed = navigation flow  
- Candlelight = mood and visibility  
- Playlist = tonal feedback  
- That awkward corner = user friction  

Everything shapes the experience. Even if no one notices directly.

## 🧾 Takeaways

- Quiet logistics are still strategy  
- Hospitality is a form of design  
- Calmness helps more than expertise  
- Deadlines are real — people *will* arrive  

I learned a lot that day. And I’d help again — ideally with a floor plan, a better sound system, and maybe a few extra hands.
