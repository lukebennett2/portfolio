## Not the Planner. Just… Everything Else.

I didn’t plan the wedding. But when it came to the reception, the after-party, and the high-stakes orchestration of vibes, I somehow became the quiet force making everything run.

Picture this: a cool venue in Hackney. One extremely in-love couple. And me—accidentally responsible for turning a blank space into a living, breathing celebration.  

Not a wedding planner.  
Just a friend.  
But also: logistics lead, ops coordinator, UX strategist, floor manager, and part-time emotional support human.  

In short: I was the **product manager of the party**.

## 🏗️ From “Empty Room” to “We’re Married Now”

The venue? Gorgeous. The infrastructure? Nonexistent. We had a single afternoon to turn a glorified warehouse into a wedding. There was no margin for error, only chaos.

I managed:
- Delivery windows for drinks, catering, and florals (aka trying to keep five timelines straight)
- Tech setup and troubleshooting (because yes, Bluetooth betrayed us)
- Answering every guest’s burning questions via text (“Where is it again?” “Wait… is it formal?”)
- Keeping the couple in a pure, stress-free love bubble
- Also: arranging seating, lighting a hundred candles, building a photo wall, running a sound check, cueing the playlist—and doing it all *casually*, like it had just happened that way

Spoiler: it didn’t. But that was the point.

## 🎂 The Cake Moment (aka My Stress Apex)

Let’s talk about the cake. It was small. Elegant. Innocent. And somehow *the* most stressful detail of the entire evening. Timing the “ta-da” just right. Making sure the lights hit it softly. Ensuring the plates were ready. Hovering like a hawk while trying not to hover like a hawk.  

Not because I’m a cake person. Because I knew how much **that moment** mattered to the couple. It wasn’t about sugar. It was about symbolism. And yeah—it worked. Even the knife cut cleanly. Miracles happen.

## 💃 After-Party = Post-Launch Maintenance

Reception done? Cool. Now let’s pivot to v2. Tables moved. Lights dimmed. Plates cleared. Playlists swapped. Champagne restocked. Spontaneous drink runs initiated. The room transformed in under 20 minutes like it was a Formula 1 pit stop.

No one noticed the shift. Because they weren’t supposed to.

I had the roadmap. I knew the pain points.  
And I shipped the after-party like a damn update.

It lasted well into the night. The energy stayed up. And somehow, I still had enough left in me to dance.

## 🧠 What This Has To Do With Product? Honestly… Everything.

Weddings—especially receptions—are pure, unfiltered product management.

You're crafting an experience.  
You're balancing vision with real-world constraints.  
You're making decisions people *don’t even notice*—and that’s exactly the goal.

### What translated directly:

- **Stakeholder Management** → Keep the couple happy without turning them into decision-making machines  
- **Cross-Functional Orchestration** → DJs, caterers, friends, florists—everyone has a role  
- **Real-Time Problem Solving** → Stuff *will* break. Just don’t let it break the flow  
- **Prioritisation Under Pressure** → Some things matter. Some things can burn. Know the difference.  
- **UX for Humans** → The guests = users. How intuitive is the space? How good does it *feel*?

## 🪩 What I Didn’t Expect to Learn

I’ve worked in digital for years. But this taught me how physical space is **also design**.

- Where the drinks are placed = navigation flow  
- Where the candles go = lighting hierarchy  
- The playlist = tonal feedback loop  
- That one weird corner = user friction

It was like UI design for a room.  
Everything mattered. Everything had a reason.  
And somehow, I loved it.

## 🧾 Final Takeaways

- Real-time logistics? Brutal. Would do again.  
- Hospitality is *absolutely* design work.  
- Calmness is an underrated superpower.  
- The deadline is literal. People will arrive. It will happen. Ready or not.

And yeah, I’d do it again in a heartbeat.  
Next time I’m bringing a floor plan, a cake diagram, and an even tighter timeline buffer.

> *P.S. The couple had the time of their lives. And I got to run the best project of my career—in trainers, an all-black fit, and a state of hyperfocus only possible when everyone else is dancing.*
