## Border to Hel: No van. No signage. Just vibes.

Around 4am, somewhere deep in the Polish countryside, a teammate handed me a GPS tracker. They were wrapped in a foil blanket like a sad burrito. I clipped the tracker to my vest, nodded solemnly, and ran off into the dark like it was the most normal thing in the world.

Welcome to **Border to Hel**—a 450km ultra-relay from the German-Polish border to the tip of the Hel Peninsula (yes, that’s a real place, and yes, the name is a pun). The journey? Hellish. The pun? Worth it.

## A Very Long, Very Stupid Idea

Six runners. No van. No signage. No official anything. Just a small car, too many Google Maps tabs, and a group chat slowly dissolving into chaos. Each person took 10–15km legs, passing a shared GPS tracker like it was the One Ring.

While one poor soul ran through god-knows-where, the rest of the team tried to nap, stretch, scavenge snacks, or argue over whether the next handoff spot was an actual road or a mapping hallucination.

We slept in fields. Ate suspicious pierogi. Refilled bottles at petrol stations. Cheered each other on at checkpoints ranging from charming playgrounds to vaguely haunted lay-bys.

It took us just over 35 hours. Eventually, time stopped making sense. Everything became electrolytes and vibes.

## Group Projects, But Existential

What struck me most wasn’t the running—it was the rhythm of the group. Not the tidy, corporate teamwork of Asana boards and retros. This was the kind where no one’s slept, someone’s limping, and someone else is whispering “I think my knee just made a clicking noise.”

No one had all the answers. But someone always stepped up—recalculating the route, whispering encouragement, googling “how to stretch calves without crying.” It wasn’t always equal. It wasn’t always smooth. But it was deeply mutual.

Low ego. High trust. Just enough shared delusion to keep moving forward.

## The Hardest Part? Waiting

People assume the running is the hard bit. And it is—but not in the way you'd expect.

The real test is the *in-between*. The hours in the car waiting for your next leg. Putting on damp socks. Convincing yourself that lukewarm trail mix counts as “nutrition.” It’s like being stuck in a holding pattern where your only job is to stay ready—and not emotionally unravel.

Turns out, patience is its own kind of endurance sport.

## The End of the Road

We hit the tip of the Hel Peninsula just before sunset. The road narrowed until it disappeared—just pine trees on one side, open water on the other.

We ran the final stretch together: slower, saltier, sunburned, slightly delirious. The finish line? A wooden shack selling chips and warm beer. No fanfare. No medal. Just a loop closed, a journey done.

And somehow, that made it perfect.

## What Actually Mattered

The blisters fade. The stats get forgotten. But what sticks is how we moved together—steadily, selflessly, a little broken, but never stopping.

We passed the baton over and over, quietly and reliably. No heroics. No ego. Just six people who decided to keep going.

I still wear the race shirt. It’s hideous. But it reminds me what happens when you say yes to something slightly unhinged, surround yourself with good people, and keep moving—blisters, pierogi, and all.
