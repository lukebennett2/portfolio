## Border to Hel: No van. No signage. Just vibes.

Around 4am, somewhere deep in the Polish countryside, a teammate handed me a GPS tracker. They were wrapped in a foil blanket like a sad burrito. I clipped the tracker to my vest, nodded solemnly, and ran off into the dark like it was the most normal thing in the world.

Welcome to **Border to Hel**—a 450km ultra-relay from the German-Polish border to the tip of the Hel Peninsula (yes, that’s a real place, and yes, the name is a pun). The journey? Hellish. The pun? Worth it.

## A Very Long, Very Stupid Idea

Six runners. No van. No race signs. No one holding your hand. Just a small car, a lot of Google Maps tabs, and a group chat that slowly devolves into chaos. Each person runs 10 to 15km legs, trading off a shared GPS tracker like it’s the One Ring.

While one poor soul runs through some godforsaken back road, the rest of the team is in the car trying to nap, scavenge snacks, stretch, or argue over whether this next handoff spot is actually a road or just a typo.

We slept in fields. Ate suspicious pierogi. Refilled bottles at petrol stations. Cheered each other on at checkpoints that ranged from charming playgrounds to vaguely haunted lay-bys.

It took us 35-ish hours. At a certain point, time lost all meaning. Everything became electrolytes and vibes.

## Group Projects, But Make It Existential

Weirdly, I thought a lot about teamwork—not the corporate kind with Gantt charts, but the kind where everyone’s operating on three hours of sleep and an expired oat bar. The kind where nobody knows what’s going on, but stuff still gets done.

We dealt with cramping legs, disappearing GPS signals, and a few *mild* detours. But someone always stepped up—recalculating the route, whispering encouragement, googling “how to stretch calves without crying.” It wasn’t glamorous. It wasn’t always equal. But it was beautifully mutual.

Like the best kind of working rhythm: low ego, high trust, and just enough shared delusion to carry you forward.

## The Real Pain? Waiting Around

People assume the running is the hard part. It is. But not like you'd think.

The real test? The *in-between*. The hours stuck in the car waiting for your next leg, trying not to fall apart. Putting on wet socks. Convincing yourself lukewarm trail mix counts as “fuel.” It’s like being in a never-ending holding pattern where your only job is to stay ready—and not emotionally unravel.

Turns out, patience and preparation are just as brutal as sprinting down a dirt road at 3am.

## The End of the Road (Literally)

We hit the tip of the Hel Peninsula just before sunset. The road narrowed, then vanished—just pine trees on one side, open water on the other.

We ran the final stretch together: slower, saltier, sunburned, slightly delirious. The finish line? A wooden shack selling chips and warm beer. It was everything and nothing. No fanfare. No medal. Just a loop closed, a journey done.

And somehow, that made it perfect.

## What Actually Mattered

The blisters fade. The run stats get forgotten. But what sticks with me is the way the team moved together—steadily, selflessly, a little broken, but never stopping. We passed the baton over and over with quiet reliability.

No heroics. No ego. Just six people who decided to keep going.

I still wear the race shirt. It’s ugly as hell. But it reminds me what happens when you say yes to something slightly unhinged, surround yourself with good people, and keep moving—blisters, pierogi, and all.
