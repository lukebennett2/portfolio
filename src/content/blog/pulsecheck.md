### PulseCheck – A Quiet Tool for Loud Workplaces

Somewhere around Slack thread #15 and “just a quick sync” #3 of the day, I had a moment of clarity (read: burnout).

We don’t need more tools yelling at us.  
We need something that actually helps us check in—with the work, and with each other.

**Enter: PulseCheck.** A low-noise, low-stress check-in tool for teams who’ve had enough of digital shouting matches.

### What PulseCheck Is Not

- Not another micromanagement dashboard  
- Not a glorified to-do list  
- Not trying to reinvent your entire workflow  

It’s a soft, background companion that gently asks:  
**“How are things going, really?”**  
...and then gets out of your way.

Think: fewer metrics, more mood. Less “circle back,” more “you good?”

### Designing the Vibe First

Before I touched a UI element, I asked: _What should this feel like?_

**The color palette**  
No harsh blues. No grayscale corporate sadness. Just warm neutrals, soft golds, creamy earth tones. Like a digital cappuccino—for your brain.

**The layout**  
Rounded corners. Soft shadows. Zero sharp edges. It looks like a tool that just took a deep breath.

**The typography**  
Clean, curved sans-serif. Understated. Competent. The kind of typeface that brings snacks to the meeting.

Everything had one job: **make people feel calm.**

### How It Actually Works

Built in Figma, the prototype keeps things blissfully simple:

#### 1. The Weekly Check-In

- Pick an emoji to capture your current vibe  
- Answer three quick prompts:
  - What went well?  
  - What’s blocking you?  
  - What do you need?

#### 2. The Team Dashboard

- A virtual sticky note wall  
- Everyone’s check-ins in one place—tidy, scannable, low-drama  
- Mood-tagged, not micro-managed

#### 3. The Summary View

- Highlights themes and patterns  
- Enough context for team leads to step in, not hover  
- No pings. No busywork. Just a clear, consistent pulse.

### Copy That Doesn’t Suck

PulseCheck doesn’t nag—it nudges.

Examples of the product voice:

- “Quick heads up—your check-in’s due. No rush.”  
- “This could be a check-in instead. Want to try?”  
- “That sounds like a win. Nice one.”

It’s soft. Friendly. A little human. Like a PM who actually respects your time.

### What I Learned

- **Design is emotional.** Even a button’s color can make someone exhale or clench up.  
- **Less is more (actually).** Especially when people are already drowning in tools.  
- **You don’t need to shout.** A product that whispers can be just as effective.

### Who It’s For

- Async teams who want clarity without chaos  
- Agencies tired of status meetings that lead to... more status meetings  
- Team leads who care about people, not just progress bars  

---

### Final Thought

PulseCheck doesn’t try to do everything.  
It just tries to do one thing really well:  
**Help teams stay in sync—without the noise, the meetings, or the burnout.**

If that sounds like something your team could use, let’s talk.  
And if you’re building something in this “calm tech” space, even better. It’s kind of my thing right now.
