## A Quiet Tool for Loud Workplaces

Somewhere around Slack thread #15 and “just a quick sync” #3 of the day, I had a moment of clarity (read: burnout).  

We don’t need more tools yelling at us.  
We need something that actually helps us **check in**—with the work, and with each other.

Enter: **PulseCheck**. A low-noise, low-stress check-in tool for teams who’ve had enough of digital shouting matches.

## ✅ What PulseCheck Is *Not*  

- Not another micromanagement dashboard  
- Not a glorified to-do list  
- Not trying to reinvent your entire workflow

It’s a soft, background companion that gently asks:  
**“How are things going, really?”**  
...and then gets out of your way.

Think: fewer metrics, more mood. Less “circle back,” more “you good?”

## 🧘 Designing the Vibe First

Before I touched a UI element, I asked:  
**What should this *feel* like?**

### The color palette?  
No harsh blues. No grayscale corporate sadness.  
Just warm neutrals, soft golds, creamy earth tones.  
Like a digital cappuccino. For your brain.

### The layout?  
Rounded corners. Soft shadows. Zero sharp edges.  
It looks like a tool that just took a deep breath.

### The typography?  
Clean, curved sans-serif. Understated. Competent.  
The kind of typeface that brings snacks to the meeting.

**Everything had one job: make people feel calm.**

## 🧪 How It Actually Works

Built in Figma, the prototype keeps things blissfully simple:

### 1. The Weekly Check-In  
- Pick an emoji to capture your current vibe  
- Answer three quick prompts:  
  - What went well?  
  - What’s blocking you?  
  - What do you need?

### 2. The Team Dashboard  
- A virtual sticky note wall  
- Everyone’s check-ins in one place—tidy, scannable, low-drama

### 3. The Summary View  
- Highlights themes and patterns  
- Enough context for team leads to step in, not hover

No pings. No busywork. Just a clear, consistent pulse.

## 🗣️ Copy That Doesn’t Suck

One of my favorite bits was writing the product voice.  
PulseCheck doesn’t nag—it nudges.

### Examples:
> 🔁 “Quick heads up—your check-in’s due. No rush.”  
> 💤 “This could be a check-in instead. Want to try?”

It’s soft. Friendly. A little human. Like a PM who actually respects your time.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- **Design is emotional** – Even a button’s color can make someone exhale or clench up  
- **Less is more (actually)** – Especially when people are already drowning in tools  
- **You don’t need to shout** – A product that *whispers* can be just as effective

---

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Who It’s For

- Async teams who want clarity without chaos  
- Agencies tired of status meetings that lead to... more status meetings  
- Team leads who care about *people*, not just progress bars  

---

## Final Thought

PulseCheck doesn’t try to do everything.  
It just tries to do one thing **really** well:  
**Help teams stay in sync—without the noise, the meetings, or the burnout.**

If that sounds like something your team could use, let’s talk.  
And if you’re building something in this “calm tech” space, even better. It’s kind of my thing right now.
