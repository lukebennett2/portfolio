## How to Work With Me: A Field Guide

After five years building products, scaling startups, and working across design, brand, and growth, I’ve noticed a pattern:

**The best work doesn’t just come from great people. It comes from people who know how to work well together.**

So I wrote this to make the invisible stuff visible: how I think, how I work, what I care about, and how to get the best from me. If we ever work together, this might save us a few syncs.

---

### TL;DR

- I move fast, but I think deeply.
- I’ll ask uncomfortable questions early, so we don’t end up in the wrong place later.
- I treat ambiguity as a feature, not a bug.
- I’ll probably rewrite your onboarding doc for clarity. (Sorry. It’s how I show love.)
- I believe the best teams are built on *clarity*, *autonomy*, and *a shared sense of momentum.*

## How I Think

1. **I lead with questions, not opinions.**  
   Before solving anything, I try to understand the system it lives in. That might mean a user interview, a messy whiteboard, or asking, “But what are we *really* solving here?”

2. **I think in systems, even when I’m building stories.**  
   Whether it's product architecture or marketing messaging, I’m always looking for scalable structures and repeatable patterns.

3. **I care about the ‘why’ as much as the ‘what’.**  
   I’ll always bring the rationale with the recommendation. Strategy and story go hand-in-hand.

## How I Work

1. **I bias toward momentum.**  
   I’ll move early—even if it’s not perfect—because learning beats guessing. You’ll see me prototyping in Figma or drafting a doc while others are still aligning calendars.

2. **I default to clarity.**  
   I’d rather over-communicate than leave people confused. If the docs feel too good for Notion… yeah, that was probably me.

3. **I thrive with autonomy and high trust.**  
   Tell me where we’re headed, and I’ll figure out the rest. I love teams that move fast without breaking each other.

## What I Value in Teams

- **High-context decision-making.**  
  Give me teammates who understand the customer, the numbers, and the why.

- **Direct feedback and low ego.**  
  I love when someone makes my idea better. Or throws it out entirely.

- **Curiosity over certainty.**  
  No one's got it all figured out. I respect teammates who ask good questions and stay open to new info.

## What You’ll Get From Me

- A structured thinker who can turn ambiguity into action.
- A creative collaborator who actually ships things.
- A cross-functional mindset. I’ve worked in product, marketing, ops, and brand—and speak all those languages.
- Care. I sweat the details because I care about the outcome.

## How to Work With Me

| If you want... | Do this: |
|----------------|----------|
| Me to go deep on something | Loop me in early. Let’s shape it together. |
| Faster momentum | Give me context, then let me run. |
| Fewer misunderstandings | Let’s talk in docs. I’ll always clarify. |
| Honest feedback | Be direct. I’d rather hear it early. |
| A better onboarding doc | Let me quietly rewrite it. (Again, sorry.) |

## Why I Wrote This

Because the best working relationships start before the kickoff call.  
Because I’ve spent enough time in ambiguous roles to know that clarity is the real unlock.  
And because a field guide is better than another 1:1 about “how we like to work.”
