### Cult Status — A Card Game About Jobs, Power, and Chaos

It started with a simple question:  
What if job titles were currency? And what if your entire career could be sabotaged by a bad vibes intern?

That became **Cult Status** — a strategic, chaotic, and slightly unhinged card game where players build the most enviable, cursed, or absurd career arc imaginable.

### The Concept

You begin as an intern with one mildly embarrassing job title.

Each round, you:
- Draw from the **Job Deck** — roles like "Junior Visionary" or "Vibes Strategist"
- Play **Event Cards** that introduce layoffs, office romances, or viral disasters
- Strategically upgrade, pivot, or sabotage others

**The goal:**  
Reach **Cult Status** — a legendary or ludicrous career path that breaks the simulation.

Multiple win conditions:
- Climb to a C-Suite role without ever doing real work
- Assemble a perfect narrative arc (to you, not HR)
- Gain enough followers to escape into a personal brand and leave capitalism behind

### Designing the Mechanics

Most workplace games lean heavily on improv. I wanted real strategy.

**Core mechanics include:**
- **Career Path Building** – Players lay out their career like a timeline. Synergies and penalties trigger based on path combos.
- **Public + Private Goals** – Everyone races toward shared objectives _and_ hides secret ones (e.g. "Steal someone’s dream job", "Burn out by Round 4").
- **Reputation System** – Your in-game choices affect your industry rep, influencing how others (and events) treat you.

### The Vibe

I wanted it to look like a cursed startup pitch deck met a 90s zine.

- Loud gradients, brutalist layouts, corporate greys
- Fonts that are slightly _too_ confident
- Icons that feel more like emoji than illustrations

Some card examples:
- **“Get promoted for fixing a problem you caused”**
- **“Start a podcast, lose 1 reputation”**
- **“Join a stealth startup. No one knows what you do. Not even you.”**

The UX writing is part product satire, part burnout memoir.

### What I’m Prototyping Next

- A printable beta version (~60–80 cards)
- New “Narrative Arc” cards that layer on mini storylines per player
- A web-based playtest tool for tracking score and chaos (built in Framer)

### Why I Built It

Because career progression is weird.  
Because most work games are either boring or mean.  
Because chaos mirrors reality better than structure.

And honestly? Because I needed a project that made me laugh _and_ made me think.

If you're into workplace satire, low-stakes strategy, or chaotic career-building, I'd love to hear your thoughts (or challenge you to a game).
