## Why this matters

The title *Product Manager* hides a lot of variety.  
From one company to the next, even from one team to another, the expectations for a PM can be wildly different.

Some PMs obsess over strategy.  
Some over execution.  
Some over people.  
All valid. All valuable. But **not interchangeable**.

Understanding the “flavour” of PM you are (or need) is the first step to working better—whether you're hiring, collaborating, or figuring out your career path.

## 🧂 The Flavours

These aren’t rigid boxes. They’re blends. Most PMs show up as a mix of these traits—but usually with one dominant flavour.

---

### 1. **The Builder PM**  
**Core traits:** technical, shipping-focused, pragmatic

Builder PMs live in the backlog. They care about how things work, how fast they can go live, and how to keep engineering unblocked. Think API endpoints, sprints, tradeoffs, and MVPs.

**Strengths:**  
- Strong execution and delivery  
- Trusted by engineers  
- Great at scoping and prioritising

**Watch-outs:**  
- May lean too execution-heavy  
- Can deprioritise research, discovery, or design nuance

---

### 2. **The Visionary PM**  
**Core traits:** strategic, opinionated, long-term thinker

They’re all about the bigger picture. They write narratives, sketch roadmaps, and ask “Where are we headed?” more than “What’s next sprint?” You’ll find them talking to execs, defining positioning, and pitching what’s possible.

**Strengths:**  
- Strong direction-setting  
- Inspires teams with big ideas  
- Helps align product with business goals

**Watch-outs:**  
- May struggle with execution details  
- Can be less effective in fast-paced, reactive environments

---

### 3. **The Research-Led PM**  
**Core traits:** user-focused, curious, insights-driven

This PM starts with the problem, not the feature. They run interviews, map journeys, and thrive in the ambiguity of “what’s broken and why?” They’re the team’s empathy engine.

**Strengths:**  
- Deep understanding of users  
- Helps teams build the *right* things  
- Balances qualitative and quantitative inputs

**Watch-outs:**  
- Can get stuck in discovery loops  
- May struggle with assertive decision-making

---

### 4. **The Process-Oriented PM**  
**Core traits:** operational, organised, facilitator

This PM brings the calm. They run great standups. They know which doc links are out of date. They make cross-functional teams feel like real teams. Less flashy, more essential.

**Strengths:**  
- Keeps everything moving smoothly  
- Great collaborator  
- Excellent at removing friction for the team

**Watch-outs:**  
- May avoid making product calls themselves  
- Can become overly focused on frameworks over outcomes

---

### 5. **The Glue PM**  
**Core traits:** adaptable, people-first, relational

This PM doesn’t dominate the room—but they hold it together. They spot interpersonal dynamics, catch what’s unsaid, and keep people motivated and connected. When stuff gets weird, they hold the thread.

**Strengths:**  
- Deeply trusted by the team  
- Keeps momentum during ambiguity  
- Excellent at stakeholder management

**Watch-outs:**  
- May struggle to draw hard lines  
- Needs strong collaborators to balance depth

---

## So… which one are you?

Most PMs are hybrids.  
You might be 60% Builder, 30% Glue, and a dash of Visionary. Or someone else might shift flavours depending on the team’s needs.

The key is **self-awareness**:  
- What flavour are you naturally?
- What flavour does your team or org actually need?
- What are you working toward becoming?

## Final thoughts

There’s no single way to be a great product manager. But knowing your flavour helps you:
- **Play to your strengths**  
- **Hire more effectively**  
- **Build better-balanced teams**  
- **Identify your next growth edge**

> Product is a team sport. Know what you bring—and what you need in others.
