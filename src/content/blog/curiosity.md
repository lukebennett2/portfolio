## The Multitasking Menace Rises

I’ve never really seen myself as a “specialist.” I mean, I *get* it—specialists are cool. They go deep. They become wizards of their domain. They have podcasts.

But me? I’ve always been more... patchwork. A little strategy here, some brand over there, a dash of product, some writing, design, tech, logistics, and the occasional existential crisis. Most of it learned by doing. Some by watching. The rest by Googling things at 1am like “how to make something not look terrible in CSS.”

## Curiosity: My One Consistent Personality Trait

If there’s a theme to my entire career, it’s this: I like poking at things.

Not in a “hobbyist tinkerer” way. More in a “how does this weird thing connect to that other weird thing” kind of way. I can’t silo. If I’m designing a landing page, I want to know the business goal. If I’m planning a race, I’m also thinking about the narrative, the map design, the registration UX, and whether the typography feels like “grit” or “grit with flair.”

It’s not about micromanaging. It’s about *caring.* About knowing enough context to make something that actually works—and doesn’t make me bored halfway through.

## I Like Building the Whole Thing

There’s something deeply satisfying about shaping a thing all the way through. From scrappy idea to actual, hold-it-in-your-hands execution.

Take **Crews to the Coast**. I wasn’t just doing logistics. I was designing the brand identity, pitching sponsors, writing copy, mapping the route, planning the social rollout, and helping carry boxes at 6am. That’s not a brag—it’s just what felt *right*. I liked moving between the creative and operational bits. It made the whole thing more cohesive. More *mine*.

Same with **BuildStuff**, the creative sprint thing I built. I wrote the brand story, designed the UI, built the site, wrote the invites, and plotted a potential roadmap like a man with too many whiteboards. The lines between roles weren’t boundaries. They were suggestions.

## Is It Glamorous? LOL No.

This style of working isn’t some dreamy montage. It’s often me alone, hunched over a laptop at a weird hour, questioning life and spacing out to the hum of a Notion doc.

Sometimes I context-switch too fast and forget what year it is. Sometimes I make gorgeous design decisions that turn out to be engineering nightmares. Sometimes I wish I *was* a specialist—just one clean lane, no side quests.

But I keep choosing this. Because despite the chaos, it gives me energy. I like being able to see something through. To figure things out. To know how something came together because I touched every weird little part.

## Teamwork Still Slaps

Let’s be clear: I *love* working with people who go deep.

Some of my favourite work has been in teams with brilliant engineers, writers, designers, PMs—people who make me better. I’m not trying to lone wolf it. I just like being the person who sees across the board, who connects the dots, who understands just enough of each lane to not derail the whole train.

The key is in the handoffs. In respecting the craft of others while staying curious enough to ask smart questions and contribute something useful.

## Why This Works (For Me)

- I think in systems, so I like seeing how parts click together  
- I’m impatient, so I like unblocking myself when something breaks  
- I’m curious, so I like knowing how stuff works under the hood  
- I’m independent, so I like making things without waiting for sign-off  
- I’m a little chaotic, so I enjoy the weird no-man’s-land between roles  

But mostly? I just like **making stuff**. And making stuff usually requires wearing more than one hat, whether you meant to or not.

## Not a Job Title—A Lifestyle?

I don’t know what this role is called. Creative technologist? Multi-hyphenate? Generalist with commitment issues? Who knows. The title isn’t the point.

The point is this: I like working across disciplines because it’s fun. It’s messy. It’s personal. It’s how I’ve made some of the best things I’ve ever made.

If you’re reading this and nodding—hey, you’re not alone. There’s space for people like us.

Sometimes, you just have to build it yourself.
