## Curiosity is a Productive Instinct

I’ve always been drawn to the connective tissue between disciplines. I’m interested in how things work not just in isolation, but together—as part of a system. That curiosity has led me across design, strategy, product, content, and operations. Not out of indecision, but because I believe the most impactful work lives in the overlaps.

This way of working isn’t about doing everything. It’s about understanding enough of each part to make better decisions. It’s about zooming out to see the full picture and then zooming in to move things forward.

## How I Think (Visualised)

At the heart of my approach is a curiosity loop that moves from exploration to execution.

This model guides how I approach projects: I begin by seeking context, asking better questions, and understanding the broader environment. From there, I use systems thinking to identify dependencies and opportunities, frame problems strategically, and move into creative execution. The outcome is product decisions that are both aligned and intentional.

## From Systems to Strategy to Detail

This mindset has shaped how I approach building digital products.

At **Ogma**, I helped shape our AI writing assistant for speech and language therapists. I wasn’t just focused on growth—I worked closely with product and engineering to understand the friction points in onboarding, map out activation flows, rewrite prompts to improve output quality, and experiment with value delivery through UX. I also led experiments around user trust and clinical safety, which meant bridging design decisions with technical constraints and regulatory realities.

The same cross-functional approach defined my time at **Atom Learning**, where I helped evolve our parent-facing experience. I contributed to product strategy, copy, onboarding, and campaign execution—often all within the same project. When we launched a new parent dashboard, I helped test messaging variants, worked with the design team to surface key moments of value, and helped refine the user journey based on activation data. The goal wasn’t just to ship—it was to ship something that made sense across disciplines.

These projects taught me how to hold context. How to move between research, UX, technical scoping, and comms without losing momentum. And how to make decisions that weren’t just functional, but meaningful to the people using the thing we were building.

## The Value of Working Across Disciplines

There are tradeoffs to working this way. Context switching is real. It can be hard to explain what your role is when it spans multiple categories. But the benefit is a more integrated approach—where the left hand always knows what the right hand is doing.

This kind of interdisciplinary thinking is especially useful in product environments, where decisions are rarely cleanly divided. A product flow might depend on marketing context. A brand decision might influence how a feature is understood. A user insight might reshape the technical scope.

Being able to see across those layers—and speak the language of each one—makes collaboration more fluid and the end result more coherent.

## Collaboration Is Still the Core

Working across functions doesn’t mean working alone. In fact, the best projects I’ve been part of are those where deep specialists bring their craft to the table, and I help translate, connect, and align.

Whether I’m working with engineers, designers, content leads or ops teams, my goal is the same: to ensure we’re building the right thing—and building it well.

I care about momentum. I care about quality. And I care about making sure the dots connect across the user experience, the business need, and the creative opportunity.

## Why This Works (For Me)

- I think in systems — which helps me map dependencies early  
- I ask strategic questions — to understand goals and tradeoffs  
- I move between abstraction and detail — from roadmap to copy edits  
- I stay curious — and go deep when needed to unblock myself or others  
- I enjoy clarity — and help teams align around a shared vision  

These aren’t buzzwords. They’re how I work.

## A Role Without a Name

There’s no perfect job title for what I do. Some call it creative technology. Others call it generalist product thinking. I’m not sure it needs a name.

What matters more is how it shows up in the work: products that feel intentional, brands that communicate clearly, experiences that resonate across every touchpoint.

Curiosity has always been my starting point. And over time, it’s become more than a trait—it’s become a strategy. One that helps me build better things, with better people, in ways that feel whole.

If you’re wired the same way—if you see the edges and want to connect them—you’re not alone. There’s space for this kind of thinking. And often, there’s need for it.

Sometimes, the best thing you can do is zoom out, ask why, and start building from there.
