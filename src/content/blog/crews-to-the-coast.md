## We Didn’t Mean to Start a Movement (But Oops, We Did)

Crews to the Coast didn’t begin with a budget, or a brand partner, or even a functional spreadsheet. It started with a single question:

**What if running events didn’t suck?**

What if they weren’t ultra-serious, over-branded, looped-around-a-park snoozefests? What if they were weird, joyful, chaotic—in the best possible way? What if they *moved*?

## 🛠️ 2022: The Scrappy Origin Story™

In 2022, I mapped out a janky 160km route from London to Margate, DM’d some running crews, and said, “Wanna try something dumb?” That was the pitch.

No app. No platform. Just vibes and a few garbled voice notes. Puma got involved somehow (shout out to them for saying yes to madness). Eight teams signed up. The baton was a *golden traffic cone.* Checkpoints were hand-drawn maps I sent at 11pm. Comms? A single chaotic WhatsApp group.

People got lost. Some legs ended in towns no one intended to visit. But no one whined. Crews helped each other, improvised, made it up as they went. And when everyone sprinted into the sea together at the end, it didn’t feel like a race. It felt like a fever dream we all decided to believe in.

## ⚙️ 2023: Now With Structure (and Adidas)

By 2023, things got… real. Like, *spreadsheet real*. We partnered with Adidas. Over 120 runners. More than 20 teams. People actually trained for it. Wild.

Scaling meant building behind-the-scenes infrastructure that looked suspiciously like project management. Suddenly we had:
- Google Sheets that could probably qualify for a PhD
- Checkpoint staff briefings
- Shared folders, brand guidelines, printed race passports
- Custom finish line stickers. STICKERS.

I designed everything—from the team briefings to the typography on the checkpoint signs. On race day, I was texting crew captains, filming with content teams, rerouting volunteers, and answering SOS calls like a sweaty air traffic controller.

It was total chaos. But also kind of beautiful.

## 🎯 2024: A Bigger Vision, More Moving Parts, Same Heart

This year, we’re teaming up with **Saucony**—a brand that gets the culture *and* the chaos.

The race is bigger, yes. But it’s also sharper, more intentional. And now I’m fully directing the creative and operational side, which includes:
- Designing a 160km route through six boroughs, four counties, and way too many cows
- Building the entire brand system: merch, maps, team kits, weird little signs
- Writing copy for every single touchpoint (yes, even the emergency toilet guide)
- Coordinating volunteers, film crews, photographers, snacks, everything
- Running the social storytelling engine that shows the soul of it all

Every crew gets a digital guide. There are playlists. Posters. Planned rollouts. Every detail is weirdly personal and slightly overthought—just how we like it.

Oh, and this year? We’re adding *narrative.* Every team has a story. The race is becoming a platform for people to test themselves, show up for each other, and be seen. It’s more than a run—it’s a collective plotline.

## 🧠 The 90% No One Sees

People see a finish line and think, “Cool event.” But most of it? Invisible.

There’s the community work: inviting crews, building trust, explaining things like “you’ll probably get lost but that’s fine.”  
There’s the ops: checkpoint briefs, backup routes, banana distribution.  
There’s the brand partnership side: aligning the messy magic with clean KPIs.

And there’s the emotional labour: keeping the soul of the thing alive while balancing logistics, ambition, and last-minute chaos.

But I live for this stuff. I love shaping things that feel human. I love turning spreadsheets into stories. I love watching people do something hard, ridiculous, and unforgettable.

## 🏁 Why It Matters

Crews to the Coast isn’t just another race.

It’s proof that grassroots creativity *can* scale. That community-led events can be both beautifully designed *and* a little scrappy. That you don’t have to choose between soul and structure.

It’s taught me a lot about creative direction, leadership, logistics—and honestly, humanity. Because when you build something good and hand it to a community? They *run* with it. Literally.

This year’s edition is almost here. The teams are training. The route is ready. My to-do list is terrifying.  

But that finish line? Always, always worth it.
