## From a Simple Idea to a Moving Platform

Crews to the Coast began without a brand, a budget, or even a clean spreadsheet. It started with a question:

**What if running events felt less like races—and more like collective adventures?**

The goal was simple: create something different. Something built on energy, creativity, and community.

## 2022: A Lo-Fi Beginning

In 2022, I mapped a 160km route from London to Margate, messaged a handful of local running crews, and floated the idea.

No platform. No app. Just shared documents, voice notes, and a loosely connected WhatsApp group. Puma came on board (somehow), and eight teams signed up. The baton was a golden traffic cone. The checkpoints were marked by hand-drawn maps, and instructions were often sent the night before.

Despite the chaos, or maybe because of it, the event worked. Crews supported one another. Teams adapted. When everyone ran into the sea together at the finish, it felt less like a finish line—and more like a shared story that everyone helped write.

## 2023: Scaling Up With Intention

In 2023, we partnered with Adidas. More than 120 runners across 20+ teams took part. The event began to take on structure.

That meant designing operational systems to support the scale:  
- Shared folders, team kits, race passports, and briefing packs  
- Google Sheets tracking every leg and checkpoint  
- Visual identity across signage, merch, and social comms  
- Volunteers, marshals, and content teams all working in sync  

On race day, I directed the operational side while managing the creative identity—briefing captains, coordinating media, and solving real-time issues behind the scenes.

It was a lot. But the result was an experience that still felt grounded in community and creativity.

## 2024: A Clearer Vision, A Stronger Foundation

This year, we’re partnering with **Saucony**—a brand aligned with the cultural spirit and creative energy of the event.

The vision is bigger, but also more focused. I’m leading both the creative direction and operational planning, including:
- Designing a 160km route through six boroughs and four counties  
- Building a brand system from the ground up: signs, kits, maps, merch  
- Writing every participant-facing touchpoint—from onboarding decks to emergency contact guides  
- Coordinating volunteers, film crews, and logistics across the full route  
- Developing the storylines that give the event its tone and emotional shape  

The attention to detail is intentional. This year, every team has a narrative. The race becomes a storytelling platform—one that moves.

## Behind the Scenes: What Doesn’t Get Noticed

The majority of the work is invisible.

There’s the early community-building: reaching out to crews, earning trust, welcoming new groups. There’s the operational backbone: setting up systems, route checks, and logistical backups. And then there’s the emotional work—keeping the tone right, making it feel inclusive, and ensuring the original spirit of the event isn’t lost as it grows.

I care deeply about both the experience and the execution. Turning complexity into something seamless is where the real challenge lies—and where the most satisfying work happens.

## Why It Matters

Crews to the Coast is more than a race.

It’s a case study in how creative, grassroots experiences can scale—without losing what made them special. It’s shown me how thoughtful systems and strong storytelling can turn a single idea into something shared, evolving, and meaningful.

It’s taught me a lot—about creative direction, operations, leadership, and people.

And most importantly: when you build something that resonates, and you hand it to a community—they’ll carry it further than you imagined.

Literally.

The 2024 edition is nearly here. The teams are training. The route is ready. There’s still a lot to do. But I can already see the finish line—and it’s going to be worth every step.
