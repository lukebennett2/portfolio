## We Didn’t Mean to Start a Movement (But Oops, We Did)

Crews to the Coast didn’t begin with a budget. Or a brand partner. Or even a functioning spreadsheet. It started with a question:

**What if running events didn’t suck?**

What if they weren’t ultra-serious, looped-around-a-park snoozefests? What if they were weird, joyful, chaotic—in the best possible way? What if they *moved*?

## 🛠️ 2022: The Scrappy Origin Story™

In 2022, I mapped a rough 160km route from London to Margate, DM’d a few running crews, and asked:  
“Wanna try something dumb?”

No app. No platform. Just vibes and a few garbled voice notes. Puma got involved somehow (shout out to them for saying yes to madness). Eight teams signed up. The baton? A *golden traffic cone*. Checkpoints? Hand-drawn maps I sent at 11pm. Comms? A single chaotic WhatsApp group.

People got lost. Some legs ended in towns no one meant to visit. But no one complained. Crews helped each other. Improvised. Made it up as they went. When everyone ran into the sea together at the end, it didn’t feel like a race. It felt like a collective hallucination we’d all decided to believe in.

## ⚙️ 2023: Now With Structure (and Adidas)

By 2023, things got real. Like, *spreadsheet real*. We partnered with Adidas. Over 120 runners. More than 20 teams. People actually trained.

Scaling meant building behind-the-scenes infrastructure that looked suspiciously like project management. Suddenly there were:
- Google Sheets that could pass as PhD theses
- Checkpoint staff briefings
- Shared folders, race passports, brand guidelines
- Custom finish line stickers. (STICKERS.)

I designed everything—from the typography on checkpoint signs to the briefing packs. On race day, I was texting captains, filming with content teams, rerouting volunteers, and answering SOS calls like a sweaty air traffic controller.

It was chaos. But the good kind.

## 🎯 2024: Bigger Vision. More Moving Parts. Same Heart.

This year, we’re partnering with **Saucony**—a brand that gets both the culture *and* the chaos.

Yes, the race is bigger. But it’s also sharper, more intentional. I’m fully directing the creative and operational side, which includes:
- Designing a 160km route across six boroughs and four counties (plus cows)
- Building the brand system: merch, maps, team kits, signs
- Writing every touchpoint—from onboarding decks to emergency toilet guides
- Coordinating volunteers, film crews, photographers, snacks
- Running the storytelling engine that shows the heart of the event

There are digital guides. Playlists. Posters. Planned rollouts. Every detail is weirdly personal and slightly overthought—just how we like it.

And this year? There’s *narrative.* Every team has a story. The race becomes a platform. A collective plotline in motion.

## 🧠 The 90% You Don’t See

People see a finish line and think, “Cool event.” But most of it? Invisible.

There’s the community work: inviting crews, building trust, explaining that yes, you might get lost, and that’s fine. There’s the ops: staff briefs, backup routes, banana logistics. There’s the brand side: translating the messy magic into something that makes KPI sense.

And there’s the emotional labour: keeping the soul of it alive while juggling logistics, ambition, and late-night chaos.

But I love it. I love shaping things that feel human. I love turning spreadsheets into stories. I love watching people do something hard, joyful, and unforgettable.

## 🏁 Why It Matters

Crews to the Coast isn’t just another race.

It’s proof that grassroots creativity *can* scale. That community-led events can be both beautifully designed *and* a little scrappy. That you don’t have to choose between soul and structure.

It’s taught me a lot—about creative direction, logistics, leadership, and people. Because when you build something good and hand it to a community?

They *run* with it.

Literally.This year’s edition is almost here. The teams are training. The route is ready. My to-do list is terrifying. But that finish line?

Always, always worth it.
