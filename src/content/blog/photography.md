## Not a Photographer™, Just Someone Who Can’t Stop Shooting

I didn’t study photography. I never had a mentor. I didn’t even have a real camera until embarrassingly recently. I just started noticing things I wanted to remember—and figured I might as well document them.

At first, it was small: a trail, a friend mid-laugh, a weird building in golden hour light. But it grew. It became a habit. Then a tool. Then a part of how I work, how I explore, how I understand where I’ve been.

## What I Like to Shoot (aka, Please Act Natural)

I’m drawn to natural light, real people, and places that don’t feel overly touched. I like catching moments just before or after something happens—the glance, the pause, the nothing-special that ends up being everything.

Somewhere along the way, that’s turned into:
- Urban and trail running events (especially the Stash ones I somehow end up directing *and* photographing)
- Travel shots: landscapes, coastlines, stray details of cities I don’t live in
- Candid portraits of friends—usually during day trips, long walks, or “hold still, this light is perfect” interruptions
- Behind-the-scenes stuff for projects like **Ogma Therapy**, **Booked.**, or whatever strange thing I’m building at the moment

It’s not just about aesthetics. My photos have accidentally become a sort of record—of people I care about, places I miss, things I’ve built. Like a visual journal I didn’t plan on keeping but now can’t stop flipping through.

## Gear Talk (But Not in a Gearhead Way)

I shoot with a Fujifilm X-series digital camera most of the time. It’s fast, light, and doesn’t make me feel like I’m lugging around a telescope. When I want to slow things down, I pull out a 35mm film camera and let the process breathe a bit.

And yes, I’ve taken some of my favorite photos on an iPhone. Because sometimes the best camera is just the one you actually bothered to bring.

I’m not precious about gear. Fancy kit is cool, but consistency and curiosity go further. I’ve met people with $4,000 lenses and zero vision. I’ll take the reverse every time.

## How I Edit (aka, Make It Look Like It Felt)

Most of my editing lives in **Lightroom**, where I’ve built a few custom workflows to keep things visually coherent without turning everything into a VSCO cliché. I shoot in RAW, tweak exposure, clean up tones, and try to keep things feeling natural but *intentional*—like the image is saying something, not shouting.

**Photoshop** comes in when something needs fixing—bad crop, distracting blur, random guy in the background doing something weird. I don’t go full CGI, but I do like dialing in the frame until it feels like mine.

Editing’s taught me patience. And rhythm. And when to stop tweaking and just let the thing live.

## Photography As a Creative Shortcut

Photography’s been wildly useful in my work, even when it wasn’t “the point.”

It’s helped me build brand visuals, shoot content for landing pages, add personality to projects that would’ve otherwise defaulted to stock images. It saves time. It saves budget. More importantly, it makes things feel *like me*.

Whether it’s:
- Shooting race day for **Stash Running**
- Snapping portraits of speakers at some health tech thing
- Capturing textures for a product I’m launching

—being able to shoot and edit my own stuff means I can move faster, be scrappier, and build things that actually *feel* like the thing they’re trying to be.

## Why It’s Still Here

Photography fits into my life the way a good habit does: quietly, consistently, without fuss. It doesn’t need a five-hour slot on the calendar. Sometimes it’s just grabbing the camera on the way out the door and catching a moment before it disappears.

It’s the creative practice that reminds me to look up, to slow down, to *see*. It balances out the structured chaos of product sprints and design deadlines. It’s instinctive. Physical. Slightly meditative, if you squint.

And maybe best of all: there’s no endgame. No final level. Just more frames to catch, more light to chase.
