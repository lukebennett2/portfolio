## A Gift, Then an Idea

This project began not as a book, but as a birthday present. I wanted to give my friend Larissa something thoughtful and handmade—something that felt more personal than another novelty mug. So I wrote and illustrated a short children’s story featuring a character loosely inspired by her: a cat named Larry.

## Meet Larry

Larry is a tabby cat with an overactive imagination and a tendency to find herself in increasingly surreal situations. She has no formal responsibilities, a collection of sweaters, and what could generously be described as an ambiguous relationship with a llama.

She’s a reluctant protagonist—curious, overwhelmed, and trying her best to make sense of the world.

## A Light Narrative, Heavy on Atmosphere

The story opens with Larry on a boat.

There’s a kraken. Immediately.

What follows is a loosely structured journey through:
- A haunted forest of self-reflection  
- A group Zoom with animal acquaintances  
- An inexplicable ski trip  
- And a map-reading session that may or may not reveal the meaning of life

It’s abstract, intentionally unresolved, and slightly absurd. But Larry keeps going—and that’s kind of the point.

## Illustration Style and Process

Every panel was illustrated in ProCreate using a custom visual style that mixes muted palettes, expressive characters, and surreal environments. I leaned into simplified forms and dreamlike compositions, balancing softness with a slightly off-kilter tone.

Think: a children’s book written during a creative fugue state—somewhere between Wes Anderson and early Tumblr-core.

My goal was to make something that felt intimate, slightly odd, and emotionally rich—even if the narrative never quite lands anywhere traditional.

## Creative Intent

There’s no moral to this story. Larry doesn’t save the day or learn a lesson. She adapts, reflects, skis a bit, and makes it home.

In some ways, that felt more honest than the traditional arc of a children’s book. Not everything needs to resolve. Not everything needs a meaning.

## Why I Made It

Because Larissa is the kind of friend who deserves a fictional universe.

Because making something handmade and strange felt more meaningful than sending a “HBD!” text.

Because creating something with no brief and no expectations gave me space to play with tone, illustration, and narrative in a new way.

## What's Next for Larry?

Hard to say.

She might come back. She might open a record shop in Berlin. She might sleep for the foreseeable future.

For now, she lives in 12 illustrated panels—part gift, part creative exercise, part experiment in storytelling.

And that feels like enough.
