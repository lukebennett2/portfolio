## 🎁 It Started With a Birthday

I didn’t set out to write a children’s book. I set out to make my friend Larissa a birthday present. Something cute. Something unexpected. Something *better than another ceramic mug with a vaguely feminist quote* on it.

So I opened Figma.

## 🐱 Enter: Larry

Larry is a cat.

That’s basically it. But also—Larry is *all of us.*  
An emotionally complex tabby with an appetite for adventure and just a dash of existential dread.

He has no job. He wears a sweater. He skis occasionally. He’s in what might be a situationship with a llama.

And he’s the reluctant hero of a loosely structured narrative that I now refer to as: *“Larry and the Inexplicable Kraken.”*

---

## 🐙 Plot? Sort Of.

It begins with Larry on a boat.

There’s a kraken. Like, immediately. No buildup. No foreshadowing. Just full tentacle chaos from panel one.

From there, Larry goes on a journey—one that spans:
- A haunted forest of self-reflection™  
- A group Zoom with his animal friends  
- A ski trip for reasons unknown  
- And, eventually, a tactical map-reading session that *might* be about finding the meaning of life (or just groceries)

Three hours later? Larry is changed. Or at least slightly less damp.

## ✏️ The Art Style: “Pinterest, But Weird”

I drew the whole thing myself, which was fun and also completely deranged.

Visually, it’s somewhere between *Wes Anderson for toddlers* and *Lisa Frank having a quarter-life crisis.*  
Muted backgrounds, big feelings, questionable animal anatomy. You get it.

I wanted it to feel dreamy, expressive, and just a little odd—like a children’s book written during a fever nap.

---

## 🧃 The Vibe Was the Goal

There’s no moral. No lesson. Just vibes.

Larry doesn’t learn to be brave or defeat the kraken with friendship. He just… endures. Adapts. Skis a little.

And honestly? That’s more relatable than most stories I read as a kid.

---

## 💌 Why I Made It

Because Larissa is the kind of friend who *deserves* a whole fictional universe.

Because creating something physical and strange felt more meaningful than sending a “HBD!” text with confetti.

Because sometimes the best gifts are the ones that make absolutely zero sense to anyone else—but still somehow say everything.

## 🐾 What’s Next for Larry?

Unclear.

He might return. He might open a record shop in Berlin. He might just nap forever.

But for now, he exists in 12 glorious panels, living his best chaotic life.  
And that feels like enough.
