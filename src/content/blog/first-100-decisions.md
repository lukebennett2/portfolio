## The First 100 Decisions in a New Product

There’s a specific kind of energy when you're building something new. No users yet. No roadmap. Just a fuzzy hunch that _this matters_ — and a hundred micro-decisions that will shape the entire trajectory.

This piece is about those first 100 decisions.

The ones that determine whether you build the right thing — or just build.

## Decision #1: What exactly are we solving?

Obvious? Yes. But most early teams skip past this.

The real first decision isn’t the UI or the tech stack — it’s **alignment on the underlying problem**. I start by writing a one-pager that answers:

- Who is this for?
- What problem are they facing _today_?
- Why now?
- What does success look like in 6 weeks, 6 months, 6 years?

## Decisions 2–10: Defining the MVP (Without Gaslighting Ourselves)

Here’s what “minimum” doesn’t mean: broken, boring, or untested.

My framework for MVP scoping:
1. **Core loop clarity**: Can a user do the _thing_ we exist to help them do?
2. **No dead ends**: Every screen should give feedback, or suggest what’s next.
3. **Confidence check**: Are we building something we can learn from fast?

The MVP isn't the baby version of your future app. It's a _test_ of your riskiest assumptions.

## Decisions 11–25: Sequencing User Discovery

“Talk to users” is great advice. But who? When? How?

Here’s my usual sequencing:
1. **Exploratory interviews** (pre-product)  
2. **Contextual inquiries** (when a prototype exists)  
3. **Usability walkthroughs** (when flows start to settle)

Tools I’ve used: Notion for notes, Maze for flows, Loom for feedback clips.

## Decisions 26–40: The Team Operating Model

Speed isn’t just about individual work. It’s how the team moves together.

Key early decisions:
- Where does work live? (Linear? Notion? Slack?)
- How do we run standups (async? weekly live?)
- What’s the artifact for decision-making? (I use short docs called “Product Notes”)

Defaulting to clarity early on saves **weeks** of revisiting vague choices later.

## Decisions 41–60: UX Infrastructure

Even a throwaway prototype needs to feel intentional.

Decisions here:
- Design tokens (colors, spacing, shadows)
- Component system (especially modals, buttons, and forms)
- Accessibility baseline

Why? Because **speed scales with reuse**. Even for early experiments.

---

## Decisions 61–80: Data Layer

Tracking too early? Overkill. But I always start with:
- Clear success metric (1 metric that matters — e.g. first check-in, invite sent)
- Mixpanel or PostHog snippet with basic funnel
- Google Sheet logging if needed

You only get clean data if you make early decisions about what you _want to know_.

## Decisions 81–90: Marketing Before Product Is Ready

I want signal as soon as possible. That means shipping a landing page _before_ the product.

Decisions to make:
- Headline language (is it benefit-led or feature-led?)
- Signup mechanism (email waitlist or instant access?)
- Where it lives (Framer? Webflow? Custom?)

Because the market won’t wait. Even a “coming soon” page teaches you something.

---

## Decisions 91–100: Knowing What NOT to Decide Yet

Some things I intentionally defer:
- Pricing strategy (until users actually want it)
- Feature naming (until they use it enough to care)
- Scalability engineering (until something breaks)

Early-stage PM is about _sequencing decisions_ — not just making them.

---

## What I’ve Learned

1. **The product starts with the problem, not the UI.**
2. **Speed doesn't come from rushing — it comes from reducing confusion.**
3. **Most bad decisions happen because people didn’t know they were making a decision at all.**

The first 100 decisions set the tone — for the team, the product, and your momentum.

Make them with intention.

If you're building from scratch, I’d love to see how _you_ structure your first 100.  
I’m always curious how other PMs map the messy beginnings.
