title: "How I Taught Myself Design"
excerpt: "I didn’t go to design school. I opened Figma, got stuck, googled my way out, and kept going. Here’s how I learned to design interfaces, brands, and full products—on my own terms."

## Fake It 'Til You Ship It

I didn’t learn design in a classroom. Or a bootcamp. Or a ten-week cohort with homework and a Slack group. I learned it because I *needed to make stuff*—and I was tired of asking other people to do it for me.

The first time I opened a design tool (hi, Figma), I stared at the screen like it had personally wronged me. I was trying to mock up a landing page for a side project, and everything felt backwards. Frames? Constraints? Auto layout? Absolute chaos.

But I kept going. Because there was no Plan B. And slowly, painfully, things started to click.

## Learning by Doing (a Lot of Wrong Things First)

I didn’t learn by watching 50 tutorials and getting certified in the Way of the Pixel. I learned by *designing things I actually needed*—and Googling my way out of every mess I made.

At first, that meant:
- Basic landing pages for weird startup ideas  
- Logo lockups that looked like they were made in MS Paint  
- Slide decks stitched together with hope and hex codes

Eventually, it turned into:
- Full product design flows  
- Visual identities for real brands  
- Merch layouts, signage, race passports, and event kits

If something needed a visual, I opened a design tool and just... figured it out. Sometimes elegantly. Sometimes in full panic mode.

## What I Use It For Now

Design is basically baked into everything I do now. It’s not a tool I *open*, it’s how I *think*. Which means I use it for:

- **Product Design** — wireframes, UI flows, hi-fi mockups, the works  
- **Brand Systems** — moodboards, logos, colour palettes, vibes  
- **Marketing** — social assets, landing pages, emails that (hopefully) convert  
- **Events** — signage, print packs, maps, merch, the whole physical world bit  

I’ve used design across all my projects—Ogma, Stash Running, BuildStuff, personal stuff, side hustles, fake brands that exist only in Figma… you get the idea.

## What Actually Helped

A few things that made the learning curve less steep and slightly less painful:

### 1. Stealing Like a Designer  
Screenshots. Everywhere. If I saw something that looked great, I tried to remake it. It was the fastest way to build taste and understand how layout, type, and spacing actually work.

### 2. Auto Layout = Life  
Once I stopped fighting it and actually learned how it worked, everything sped up. Clean files. Responsive components. No more dragging stuff around like it’s Microsoft Word 2003.

### 3. Naming Layers Like a Functioning Adult  
Not sexy, but essential. Especially when working with other people or building reusable systems. No one wants to open a file called “Frame 1947284.”

### 4. Designing for Real Use  
I wasn’t just doing “exercises.” I was making things that had to ship. That meant constraints, feedback, and actual stakes. Which made me learn faster—and care more.

## Why It Stuck

I’ve dabbled with a lot of creative tools. But design stuck because it *clicked*. It’s fast. It’s visual. It helps me go from “vague idea” to “actual thing” without begging a dev friend to help. It’s how I prototype, plan, build, explain, and experiment.

I don’t just use design tools—I *think* in them now. Structure, hierarchy, flow, energy. It’s how I untangle messes and find form.

Still learning. Always learning. That’s the best part.

*P.S. No, I still don’t use grids properly. Don’t tell anyone.*
