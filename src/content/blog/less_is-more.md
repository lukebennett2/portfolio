# The Anti-Growth Experiment: What Happens When You Remove Features?

Conventional product wisdom tells us to add. Add frictionless flows. Add features. Add nudges. Add value.

But here’s the uncomfortable truth: sometimes **growth is hiding behind the things we’ve built.**

Over the past year, I ran a few experiments rooted in a contrarian idea:

> _What happens if we try doing less?_

This post explores what I call “anti-growth experiments”—strategic reductions in product experience designed to **remove noise, increase focus, and surface what really matters**.

I’ll walk through three real examples, what we learned, and when *less* really does become *more*.

## Experiment 1: Removing Onboarding Steps (Ogma Assistant)

**The Setup:**  
Ogma Assistant is a tool that helps speech and language therapists generate clinical reports using AI. Our onboarding flow originally walked users through a 5-step tutorial: uploading a session, reviewing transcripts, adjusting report preferences, understanding security, and generating a first report.

It was clean and informative—but conversion was dropping.

**The Hypothesis:**  
Therapists weren’t confused. They were overwhelmed. Our onboarding was blocking value instead of creating it. What if we cut the steps and nudged people to learn by doing?

**What We Changed:**  
We removed 3 of the 5 onboarding steps and replaced them with:

- A single, minimal explainer  
- Inline tooltips triggered contextually  
- A floating “Need help?” button

**The Result:**

- Time-to-first-report dropped by 43%  
- Completion rate increased by 26%  
- Support messages decreased  

> _“It felt easier to just get started.”_ — Therapist, after the change

**Takeaway:**  
Don’t over-teach when users just want to try. Progression can replace explanation—if the product guides well enough.

## Experiment 2: Hiding Features Behind Intent Prompts (Rally)

**The Setup:**  
Rally is a spontaneous social planning app. You can mark yourself as “free now” or “free later,” then send lightweight invites to your crew.

In early testing, we gave users access to every feature right away. It seemed fair—why hide functionality?

But people weren’t using most of them. Worse, the app felt cluttered.

**The Hypothesis:**  
Choice paralysis was the enemy. People didn’t need more options—they needed **fewer decisions** at the start. What if we unlocked features gradually, based on what users were trying to do?

**What We Changed:**

- Hid advanced options (location sharing, group polling, etc.)  
- Prompted users only when behavior indicated need  
- Example: “Sending to 5+ people? Want to attach a location?”

**The Result:**

- Invite creation increased by 34%  
- Feature engagement rose over time (despite being hidden!)  
- Fewer drop-offs during first session  

> _“It felt lightweight. Then it just opened up when I needed more.”_

**Takeaway:**  
Minimalism isn’t about being basic. It’s about **surfacing complexity with intention**. Wait for user context—then offer power.

## Experiment 3: Cutting Email Frequency (Ogma)

**The Setup:**  
Our activation emails at Ogma were... a lot. Nudges, summaries, security reassurances, updates. All useful on paper. But open rates plateaued, and unsubscribes ticked up.

**The Hypothesis:**  
Maybe less communication would create more curiosity—and more trust. What if we did the unthinkable and... emailed less?

**What We Changed:**

- Reduced our email sequence by 40%  
- Focused each email on one outcome only  
- Added a “Need more help?” CTA linking to a Notion help center  

**The Result:**

- Open rates increased by 21%  
- Click-throughs held steady  
- Unsubscribes dropped to nearly zero  

> _“Nice not to be spammed. Made me actually want to read them.”_

**Takeaway:**  
You don’t need to speak louder. Just speak when it matters.

## Why Subtractive Thinking Works

Removing things from a product can feel dangerous. But these experiments taught me a few key lessons:

1. **Cognitive load is real.** Every step, button, or email taxes the user—whether they realize it or not.  
2. **Default simplicity wins.** You can always add complexity later. But earning trust means starting simple.  
3. **Silence builds trust.** Not everything needs a push notification. Sometimes being quiet makes your product feel more confident.

## When to Try an Anti-Growth Experiment

This mindset isn’t always right—but it’s powerful in the right moment. Here’s when I’ve found it most useful:

- Users are dropping off early (look for moments of overwhelm)  
- Feature engagement is flat (try hiding them)  
- You’re shipping too much (check if value is diluted)  
- Your product feels busy (test subtraction instead of optimization)  

The best part? These experiments are usually **low-lift**. Most take a day or two to build and test.

## Final Thought

We’re so trained to equate growth with more. But sometimes the most powerful move is to **subtract with purpose**.

Cut the fluff. Remove the noise. Make space for clarity.

Sometimes, less isn’t just more. It’s *better*.

Let me know if you’ve tried subtractive experiments in your own work—I’m always curious to hear how others build momentum through simplicity.
