## Some people write poems.  
Some people cook elaborate meals.  
**I built a website.**

What started as a joke between friends spiralled into a functioning, slightly unhinged digital ecosystem—**The Louisverse**. A dedicated home for all things Louis: real merch, fake lore, mini games, cursed copy, surreal visuals, and a front-end that probably raised a few eyebrows in React land.

It was a creative experiment. A technical playground. A love letter disguised as a website. It made no sense and perfect sense at the same time.

## 🧪 From Concept to Code (AKA “What if I actually built this?”)

Like most of my side projects, this one began with zero plan, a rogue Figma file, and way too much coffee on a rainy Saturday.

The premise was simple(ish): make a site for Louis that was **playful**, **personal**, and **real**. Not a portfolio. Not a “hey look what I made” kind of thing. A *universe*. Something he could explore, share, and maybe get a laugh out of—and ideally, something that worked well enough to make people go: “Wait... you *built* this?”

### The result?

- A **React-based website** built from scratch, styled with Tailwind (because obviously)
- A connected **Shopify store** with actual, purchasable products
- **Interactive mini games** (yes, really) and secret easter eggs
- A **merch design system** complete with original prints, taglines, and packaging
- Markdown-based content so I could update it without crying into a CMS dashboard

And honestly? It kind of slapped.

## 🎨 Designing the Louisverse Brand

I didn’t want this to feel like just a pile of random internet stuff. I wanted **lore**. A world. A weird, offbeat visual identity that made people wonder whether it was satire, art, or a startup pitch gone off the rails.

So I built a visual system that walked the line between retro sci-fi aesthetics and private group chat energy:
- **Bold typography** that shouted in all caps
- **Strange gradients** that made you squint a little
- **Distorted assets** that felt slightly broken in a good way
- **Microcopy** that leaned fully into the bit (think error messages that say “Louis disapproves”)

Every page had a sense of mischief baked in. Like it was daring you to click one more link just to see what nonsense came next.

## 🧩 Making It Work (Technically and Emotionally)

Pulling this thing together meant learning a lot on the fly—wiring up e-commerce, figuring out animations, styling components so they didn’t look like a design intern’s first day, making sure everything *felt* cohesive even when it technically wasn’t.

The technical stack looked something like this:
- **React + Vite** for speed and flexibility
- **Tailwind CSS** because it lets me move fast and break spacing
- **Shopify Lite** for merch integration
- **Framer Motion** for smooth, weird animations
- **Markdown** for content, so I could iterate faster than Louis could say “you made *what*?”

And behind it all, a quiet obsession with making every single detail feel intentional, stupid, and delightful at the same time.

## 💡 What I Learned

Building the Louisverse reminded me why I love making weird little things on the internet.

It’s easy to get caught up in polished portfolios and “serious” side projects. But sometimes the best stuff comes from chasing an idea that’s just *fun*. One that doesn’t make perfect sense but *feels* right. One that stretches your creative muscles while making someone laugh—or at least go “what the hell is this and why do I love it?”

I got to:
- Push my design and development chops at the same time  
- Invent a fake brand with real emotional weight  
- Make something deeply personal that somehow resonated with other people too

## 🚀 The Louisverse Lives On

The site is live. The merch is real. The mini games kind of work. And Louis? He loved it. (Or he’s too polite to say otherwise.)

Either way, this project reminded me that the best design often lives in the strange, chaotic middle ground—between joke and art, between structure and chaos, between “why?” and “why not?”

Long live the Louisverse.  
Long live designing just because you can.
